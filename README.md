# prologExercise
Exercise in Prolog. Two hospitals exchange blood sacks between them according to the necessity and considering compabilities between tipes. Every exchange has a unitary cost. The inputs are the lists of blood sacks needed and the blood sacks available. The output is the blood sacks exchanged at minor cost. The algorithm is based on generate and test (so very inefficient)
